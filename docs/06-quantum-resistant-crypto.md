# Idea 6: Quantum-Resistant Cryptographic Migration Platform

## One-Line Pitch
A software platform automating discovery, assessment, and migration of cryptographic assets in UK financial institutions to quantum-resistant algorithms (NIST PQC standards).

## Theme Alignment
- Next-Gen Digital Technologies
- Electronics, Photonics & Quantum

## Technical Innovation
Automated cryptographic inventory scanning, quantum vulnerability risk scoring, and orchestrated migration to NIST post-quantum algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA) without service downtime. Goes beyond PQShield's algorithm libraries by providing the full enterprise migration toolchain.

## Why Now
- US federal quantum-safe mandate by 2035
- UK-US Tech Prosperity Deal quantum taskforce
- Bank of England exploring quantum impacts
- UK's £2B compute roadmap embeds quantum

## Target Customer
UK banks (Big 5), insurers, asset managers, payment processors. Secondary: NHS trusts.

## Revenue Model
Enterprise licence (£200K–£1M/year) + implementation. At 20 clients = £4M–£20M ARR.

## Budget: £4.5M
- £2.0M cryptographic R&D
- £1.0M enterprise integration
- £0.8M pilot with 3 banks
- £0.7M compliance/certification

## Timeline
First client at month 16 → break-even at month 30.

## Defensibility
NCSC certification; deep banking infrastructure integration; UK-specific compliance tooling first-mover.
