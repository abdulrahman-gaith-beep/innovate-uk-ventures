# Idea 4: NHS AI-Powered Clinical Procurement and Resource Allocation

## One-Line Pitch
An AI platform using federated learning to help NHS ICBs optimise procurement, clinical resource allocation, and demand forecasting without centralising sensitive patient data.

## Theme Alignment
- Health & Wellbeing
- AI & Digital Computing

## Technical Innovation
Federated learning architecture training cross-ICB models without data centralisation. Combines procurement spend analysis, clinical pathway modelling, and demand prediction.

## Why Now
- NHS 10 Year Health Plan (July 2025) with £10B tech investment
- 90% EPR adoption creates the data foundation
- From 2026, clinical AI requires MHRA Class IIa registration (regulatory barrier = moat)

## Target Customer
42 NHS ICBs in England. Initial: 5 early-adopter ICBs.

## Revenue Model
Annual SaaS per ICB (£150K–£500K). At 15 ICBs = £2.25M–£7.5M ARR.

## Budget: £4.5M
- £1.5M AI/ML
- £1.0M federated learning infrastructure
- £0.8M NHS pilot integrations
- £0.7M MHRA compliance
- £0.5M pre-commercial

## Timeline
NHS pilot at month 15 → first contract at month 24 → break-even at month 42.

## Risks
NHS procurement cycles (12–24 months); data governance approvals. Mitigate via NHSE Innovation Service pathway and Digital Health Hub partnerships.
