# Idea 2: Integrated AI Monitoring Platform for RAS

## One-Line Pitch
A multimodal AI platform combining underwater computer vision, hydroacoustic sensing, and water chemistry data for real-time fish welfare, feeding, and disease prediction in land-based RAS facilities.

## Theme Alignment
- Net Zero (agriculture and food)
- AI & Digital Computing
- Robotics & Smart Machines

## Technical Innovation
Transformer-based multimodal architecture fusing three data streams: (a) computer vision adapted for high-density, turbid RAS tank conditions, (b) passive hydroacoustic telemetry for stress detection, (c) continuous water quality sensors. The AI learns correlations between environmental conditions and fish behavioural biomarkers, enabling predictive rather than reactive management.

## Why Now
- UK RAS sector growing rapidly (salmon smolt, trout, emerging species)
- Precision aquaculture: $0.85B (2025) → $1.43B by 2030 (11.1% CAGR)
- Stirling University and SAIC have research but no commercial platform for RAS
- Sustainability regulations and RSPCA Assured driving welfare monitoring
- RAS Logic domain expertise provides immediate pilot access

## Target Customer
UK RAS operators, Nordic land-based farms, Middle East (Saudi NEOM projects).

## Revenue Model
Hardware lease (£15K–£30K/site) + SaaS (£2K–£5K/month). At 100 sites = £2.4M–£6M ARR.

## Budget Breakdown (£5M)
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| AI/ML and sensor fusion R&D | £1.5M |
| Custom underwater sensor hardware | £1.0M |
| Pilot at 5 UK RAS facilities | £0.8M |
| Species-specific model training | £0.5M |
| Regulatory validation, IP | £0.7M |
| Middle East pilot adaptation | £0.5M |

## Timeline
First deployment at month 20 → break-even at month 40 → £5M ARR by month 48.

## Risks
1. Sensor reliability in harsh RAS environments — 6-month durability testing
2. Limited UK market — immediate expansion to Norway and Saudi Arabia
