# Idea 1: AI-Powered Grid Flexibility Platform for C&I Buildings

> ⭐ **Top 3 Recommended**

## One-Line Pitch
An AI platform that turns commercial buildings, EV chargers, and on-site batteries into grid-flexible assets, stacking revenue from NESO's Demand Flexibility Service, local DSO markets, and wholesale trading.

## Theme Alignment
- Net Zero (energy)
- AI & Digital Computing
- Energy & Environment Technologies

## Technical Innovation
Reinforcement-learning-based optimisation engine that simultaneously manages building HVAC, EV fleet charging, and battery dispatch across multiple market signals (NESO DFS, DSO flexibility tenders, wholesale day-ahead/intraday). Unlike existing VPP operators that focus on single asset classes, this platform uses a unified digital twin of each site's energy profile, trained on half-hourly smart meter data under MHHS (Market-wide Half-Hourly Settlement rolling out 2026), to predict and monetise flexibility across asset types in real time.

## Why Now in the UK
- Clean Power 2030 requires 51–66 GW of flexibility capacity (2–3x current 24 GW)
- NESO's DFS now operates year-round with 4M+ participants, but C&I participation is minimal
- MHHS in 2026 unlocks granular settlement data that makes building-level flex viable
- £4M UKRI R&D MAP investment explicitly targets AI for grid flexibility
- National Grid + Emerald AI partnership validates the model for data centres; no equivalent for C&I buildings

## Target Customer
UK commercial building owners/operators (offices, retail parks, logistics), EV fleet operators, local authorities with building portfolios. ~150,000 non-domestic buildings with smart meters.

## Revenue Model
SaaS platform fee (£500–£2,000/month per site) + performance fee (15–25% of flexibility revenue generated). At 2,000 sites = £12M–£48M ARR.

## Budget Breakdown (£5M)
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| AI/ML engineering team (8 engineers × 30 months) | £1.8M |
| IoT hardware integration and edge computing | £0.8M |
| Pilot sites (10 live C&I buildings) | £1.0M |
| Market interface development (NESO, DSO, wholesale) | £0.7M |
| Certification, cybersecurity, pre-commercial | £0.7M |

## Commercialisation Timeline
First revenue at month 18 → break-even at month 36 → £10M+ ARR by month 48.

## Defensibility
Proprietary RL models trained on UK-specific grid data; data moat from each connected site; regulatory first-mover under MHHS; partnerships with DNOs/DSOs.

## Key Risks
1. Grid market rules still evolving — mitigate via Elexon/NESO consultation engagement
2. Customer acquisition cost for C&I sites — mitigate via partnership with energy consultancies and ESCO channels

## Repayment Plausibility
At 1,000 sites by year 3 generating £150K monthly platform fees plus £100K performance fees, annual revenue reaches £3M. Operating costs ~£2M. DSCR of 1.5x achievable by year 4 of repayment.

## Project Plan
| Phase | Months | Milestones | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| R&D Core | 1–10 | RL optimisation engine; building digital twin framework; IoT edge specs | £1.8M |
| Integration | 11–18 | NESO DFS API; 3 DSO integrations; wholesale interface; MHHS pipeline | £1.2M |
| Pilot | 19–28 | 10 live buildings; measured flexibility delivery; revenue validation | £1.2M |
| Scale | 29–42 | Automated onboarding; 500 buildings; channel partnerships | £0.8M |

## Key Hires
- Head of AI/Energy (RL + building energy)
- 3× ML Engineers (time-series + optimisation)
- IoT/Hardware Engineer (edge computing)
- Energy Markets Specialist (NESO/DSO)
- Building Energy Consultant (HVAC/BMS)
- 2× Full-stack Engineers (dashboard + APIs)

## Suggested UK Partners
- Energy Systems Catapult
- Connected Places Catapult
- Imperial College / UCL Bartlett
- UK Power Networks (DSO pilot)
- Bruntwood / Landsec (real estate pilots)
- Carbon Trust

## First 90-Day Validation
1. **Days 1–30:** Analyse 12 months of smart meter data from 5 buildings; quantify flexibility + revenue; begin Catapult engagement
2. **Days 31–60:** Build RL simulation environment; model NESO/DSO/wholesale signals; recruit Head of AI
3. **Days 61–90:** Deliver simulation showing RL outperforming rule-based by ≥15%; secure 3 building owner LOIs; submit NESO DFS registration
