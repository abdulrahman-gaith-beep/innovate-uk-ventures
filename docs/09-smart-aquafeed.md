# Idea 9: AI-Driven Smart Aquafeed Optimisation System

## One-Line Pitch
A precision feeding system using reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust feed composition, quantity, and timing in RAS — reducing feed cost ratio (FCR) by 15–20%.

## Theme Alignment
- Net Zero (agriculture and food)
- AI & Digital Computing

## Technical Innovation
RL agent optimising growth rate, FCR, water quality impact, and welfare simultaneously. Uses sensor fusion from feed dispensers, underwater weight estimation, and water chemistry probes. Unlike rule-based feeders (AKVA, Cargill), this learns optimal policies per tank, species, and growth stage.

## Why Now
- Feed = 40–60% of RAS operating costs
- Precision aquaculture growing at 11.1% CAGR
- UK RAS expansion for Atlantic salmon and trout
- RAS Logic domain expertise for immediate trials

## Target Customer
UK RAS operators, Norwegian land-based farms, GCC aquaculture projects.

## Revenue Model
Hardware lease (£10K–£20K/site) + SaaS (£1K–£3K/month). At 80 sites = £2.0M–£3.8M ARR.

## Budget: £3.5M
- £1.2M AI/RL engineering
- £0.8M hardware
- £0.7M trials at 5 sites
- £0.5M species training
- £0.3M pre-commercial

## Timeline
First sales at month 18 → break-even at month 38.

## Risks
Proving ROI across diverse species/scales. Mitigate with controlled trials and money-back guarantee.
