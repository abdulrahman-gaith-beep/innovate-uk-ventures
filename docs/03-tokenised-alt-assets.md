# Idea 3: Tokenised Alternative Asset Infrastructure for UK Family Offices

> ⭐ **Top 3 Recommended**

## One-Line Pitch
An AI-powered middleware platform enabling UK family offices and PE firms to manage, report on, and trade both tokenised and traditional alternative assets under the FCA Digital Securities Sandbox and PISCES regime.

## Theme Alignment
- Next-Gen Digital Technologies
- AI & Digital Computing

## Technical Innovation
- NLP document intelligence: auto-extract from capital calls, K-1s, smart contracts
- DLT-agnostic integration: Ethereum, Polygon, permissioned chains in FCA DSS
- AI compliance engine: maps positions against new three-tiered AIFM framework
- Real-time NAV across hybrid tokenised + traditional portfolios

## Why Now
- FCA PISCES sandbox launched 2025
- Bank of England exploring tokenised deposits in DSS
- HM Treasury AIFM overhaul consultation (April 2025)
- FCA consulting on fund tokenisation (CP25/28)
- Global asset tokenisation: $2.08T → $13.55T by 2030
- No UK-native FCA-compliant equivalent to Addepar/Masttro/Canoe
- Golden Investors network = immediate distribution

## Target Customer
UK family offices (1,000+), mid-market PE firms, wealth managers. Initial: UHNW family offices managing £50M–£5B AUM.

## Revenue Model
SaaS (£3K–£15K/month by AUM tier) + transaction fees (0.05–0.15%). At 150 clients = £5.4M–£27M ARR.

## Budget Breakdown (£5M)
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Core platform (DLT integration, smart contracts) | £1.5M |
| AI/NLP document intelligence + compliance engine | £1.0M |
| FCA regulatory engagement, DSS, legal | £0.8M |
| Security (quantum-resistant encryption) | £0.5M |
| Pilot with 10 family offices | £0.7M |
| Pre-commercial market development | £0.5M |

## Timeline
Beta at month 14 → first paying clients at month 18 → break-even at month 32 → £8M+ ARR by month 42.

## Defensibility
FCA regulatory moat (DSS/PISCES first-mover); proprietary compliance engine; data network effects from document AI; Golden Investors distribution.

## Project Plan
| Phase | Months | Milestones | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| Core Platform | 1–10 | DLT layer; NLP engine; compliance v1 | £1.8M |
| Regulatory | 11–18 | DSS participation; PISCES API; AIFM mapping; security audit | £1.2M |
| Pilot | 19–26 | 10 family office pilots; automated NAV; iteration | £1.0M |
