# Idea 10: AI Energy Flexibility Aggregator for UK C&I Prosumers

> ⭐ **Top 3 Recommended**

## One-Line Pitch
An AI-native flexibility-as-a-service platform aggregating distributed energy resources across UK C&I sites, participating in NESO wholesale, DSO local, and Demand Flexibility Service markets simultaneously.

## Theme Alignment
- Net Zero (energy)
- AI & Digital Computing
- Energy & Environment Technologies

## Technical Innovation
Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where each site is an autonomous agent and the central platform coordinates portfolio-level bids across NESO, DSO, and wholesale markets. Optimises for the portfolio, not individual sites. Incorporates P483 modification enabling sub-meter flexibility registration.

## Why Now
- UK flexibility must reach 55.2 GW by 2030 (from ~24 GW)
- Clean Flexibility Roadmap (July 2025) calls for "stackability" and aggregation
- MHHS rollout 2026 creates granular settlement infrastructure
- P483 enables sub-meter registration (October 2025)
- UK distributed energy market: $312.5B → $645.8B by 2032
- No AI-native, multi-market stacking platform exists

## Target Customer
C&I businesses with >100kW flexible capacity; energy service companies; local authority building portfolios.

## Revenue Model
Performance fee (20–30% of flexibility revenue) + SaaS (£500–£2K/month). At 500 sites / 500 MW = £15M–£30M ARR.

## Budget Breakdown (£5M)
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| AI/ML multi-agent system | £2.0M |
| Market integration APIs | £1.0M |
| Pilot with 20 sites | £0.8M |
| NESO/Elexon accreditation | £0.7M |
| Pre-commercial activities | £0.5M |

## Timeline
First trades at month 16 → break-even at month 30 → £12M+ ARR by month 42.

## Defensibility
Multi-market accreditation barriers; portfolio data moat; AI coordination advantage grows with scale; P483/MHHS first-mover.

## Project Plan
| Phase | Months | Milestones | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundation | 1–8 | Hire team; MARL training env; NESO/Elexon integration; P483 registration | £1.5M |
| Pilot | 9–18 | 20 C&I sites; first live trades; validate stacking across markets | £1.5M |
| Scale | 19–30 | 200 sites; full DSO coverage; automated onboarding; accreditation | £1.2M |
| Commercialise | 31–42 | 500 sites / 500 MW; enterprise sales; international licensing | £0.8M |

## Key Hires
- Head of Energy AI (PhD in RL/optimisation)
- 3× ML Engineers (multi-agent systems)
- Energy Markets Analyst (NESO/Elexon)
- Head of Partnerships (DNO/DSO relationships)
- 2× Full-stack Engineers
- Energy Regulation Specialist (Ofgem/NESO)

## UK Partners
- Energy Systems Catapult
- Digital Catapult
- Elexon
- Imperial College London
- UK Power Networks / SSEN / WPD (DSO pilots)
- Octopus Energy (data + channel)

## Elevator Pitch (200 words)
The UK must triple its grid flexibility capacity to 55 GW by 2030 to deliver the Clean Power Mission. Today, most commercial and industrial buildings sit idle in flexibility markets — their solar panels, batteries, EV chargers, and HVAC systems represent gigawatts of untapped capacity.

Our multi-agent reinforcement learning system treats each site as an autonomous optimiser while coordinating portfolio-level bids across NESO's Demand Flexibility Service, DSO local flexibility tenders, and wholesale markets — simultaneously. This "stackability" is exactly what the government's Clean Flexibility Roadmap calls for, and no existing aggregator can deliver it with AI-native architecture.

We're requesting a £5M Innovation Loan to complete late-stage R&D: training the multi-agent AI on live grid data, building market integration with NESO and all six DSOs, and running a 20-site pilot demonstrating 50 MW of aggregated flexibility. Our performance-fee model means revenue scales directly with portfolio growth, and the MHHS rollout in 2026 provides the data infrastructure we need.

Within three years, we'll aggregate 500+ sites and 500 MW, generating £15M+ ARR — enough to comfortably service the loan at 1.5x DSCR.

## First 90-Day Validation
1. **Days 1–30:** Secure LOIs from 5 C&I building owners; engage Elexon on P483; hire Head of Energy AI + ML engineers
2. **Days 31–60:** Simulate flexibility trading on 12 months historical data; quantify revenue per site; submit Catapult collaboration proposal
3. **Days 61–90:** Complete NESO DFS registration; finalise IoT hardware specs; deliver POC MARL agent showing 10% improvement over rule-based dispatch
