# Idea 5: AI-Accelerated Engineering Biology Bioprocess Optimisation

## One-Line Pitch
An AI platform using Bayesian optimisation and physics-informed neural networks to accelerate synthetic biology scale-up, reducing bioprocess development time by 60%.

## Theme Alignment
- Engineering Biology
- AI & Digital Computing

## Technical Innovation
Bayesian optimisation + physics-informed neural networks modelling fermentation dynamics across organism types and bioreactor scales. Addresses the UK's lab-to-factory scale-up gap.

## Why Now
- First UK engineering biology regulatory sandbox (March 2025)
- Engineering Biology Innovation Network launched (June 2025)
- Industrial Strategy identifies engineering biology as enabling platform tech
- £4T bioeconomy opportunity

## Target Customer
UK biotech SMEs/spinouts (100+), CROs/CDMOs, academic groups scaling up.

## Revenue Model
SaaS (£5K–£20K/month) + compute fees. At 50 clients = £3M–£12M ARR.

## Budget: £4.8M
- £1.8M AI/ML
- £1.2M bioreactor instrumentation
- £1.0M validation with 5 partners
- £0.8M pre-commercial

## Timeline
First clients at month 20 → break-even at month 42.

## Risks
Bio variability makes generalised models difficult. Mitigate with organism-specific model libraries.
