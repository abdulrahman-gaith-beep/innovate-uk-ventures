# Idea 7: Net Zero Digital Twin Platform for UK Social Housing

## One-Line Pitch
A physics-based + AI digital twin platform modelling every social housing dwelling to optimise retrofit investment and meet EPC Band C by 2030.

## Theme Alignment
- Net Zero (capital intensity, energy)
- AI & Digital Computing

## Technical Innovation
BIM-lite modelling (automated from EPC data + satellite imagery + smart meter feeds) combined with occupant behaviour simulation via agent-based modelling. AI-optimised investment sequencing maximises carbon reduction per pound spent across 4.4M social housing homes.

## Why Now
- Government target: all social housing to EPC Band C by 2030
- £3.8B Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund
- 1,400+ housing associations and 200+ local authority housing departments

## Target Customer
UK housing associations, local authority housing departments.

## Revenue Model
SaaS per dwelling (£2–£5/dwelling/month). At 500,000 dwellings = £12M–£30M ARR.

## Budget: £4.5M
- £1.5M AI/modelling
- £1.0M data integration
- £0.8M pilot with 3 housing associations
- £0.7M pre-commercial
- £0.5M certification

## Timeline
First contracts at month 16 → break-even at month 34.

## Risks
Slow social housing procurement and budget constraints. Mitigate via SHDF co-funding and housing association consortiums.
